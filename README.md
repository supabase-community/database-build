With [postgres.new](https://postgres.new), you can instantly spin up an unlimited number of Postgres databases that run directly in your browser (and soon, deploy them to S3). 

Each database is paired with a large language model (LLM) which opens the door to some interesting use cases:

- Drag-and-drop CSV import (generate table on the fly)
- Generate and export reports
- Generate charts
- Build database diagrams

## How it works
All queries in postgres.new run directly in your browser. Thereâ€™s no remote Postgres container or WebSocket proxy.

How is this possible? [PGlite](https://pglite.dev/), a WASM version of Postgres that can run directly in your browser. Every database that you create spins up a new instance of PGlite that exposes a fully-functional Postgres database. Data is stored in IndexedDB so that changes persist after refresh.

## Monorepo

This is a monorepo split into the following projects:

- [Frontend (Next.js)](./apps/web/): This contains the primary web app built with Next.js
- [Backend (pg-gateway)](./apps/proxy/): This serves S3-backed PGlite databases over the PG wire protocol using [pg-gateway](https://github.com/supabase-community/pg-gateway)
